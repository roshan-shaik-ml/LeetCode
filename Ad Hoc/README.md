Ad Hoc Problems
Introduction

Welcome to the repository for solving Ad Hoc problems with a focus on unconventional problem-solving techniques. Ad Hoc problems are characterized by their unique nature, often requiring creative strategies for finding solutions. This repository explores various approaches, including leveraging the principles of 2D Dynamic Programming for tackling such challenges.
Solution Approach
Subproblems Identification

Ad Hoc problems often lack clear patterns or structures, making it essential to identify key subproblems within the problem space. 2D Dynamic Programming provides a framework for breaking down these complex problems into smaller, more manageable subproblems.
Heuristics and Intuition

Given the diverse and unstructured nature of Ad Hoc problems, relying on heuristics and intuition is often necessary. Combining these with the principles of 2D Dynamic Programming can lead to innovative and effective problem-solving strategies.
Brute Force vs. Optimization

While brute force approaches may be feasible for smaller instances of Ad Hoc problems, optimization techniques such as 2D Dynamic Programming can significantly improve efficiency for larger problem sizes.
Use Cases

    Chessboard Problems: Ad Hoc problems involving chessboard configurations often require finding optimal solutions for various scenarios. 2D Dynamic Programming can be applied to efficiently compute solutions for each cell or position on the chessboard.

    String Manipulation: Ad Hoc problems related to string manipulation, such as pattern matching or generating permutations, can benefit from 2D Dynamic Programming techniques for optimizing substring operations.

    Puzzle Solving: Many puzzles and games fall into the Ad Hoc category, demanding creative problem-solving approaches. Integrating 2D Dynamic Programming can help explore and analyze possible game states or puzzle configurations efficiently.
